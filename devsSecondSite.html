    <p style="margin: 10px; color:rgb(99, 61, 98); border: 10pt ; border-color: darkmagenta ; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">I thought that the reading was really interesting how Bush was predicting future technology in a year as long ago as 1945. 
        He discusses things that we see as common such as digital cameras and computers with such odd language because, at that time, 
        there weren't any official words to describe those things that wouldn't exist for years upon years later. 
        It makkes me think about how there could be things hat we can only imagine now that will be common in the future, and that is exciting to think about.
