<p>The series "Ways of Seeing" was quite interesting and honestly I was not expecting it to be about what it was about. 
    It was made in the 1970's so it was after the invention of the computer but before the popularization of the personal computer.
 The series coveres many topics such as images, advertisemnets, sexism, and technoloogy. 
 I thought many of the topics were interesting, especially when trying to connect it back to web development. 
One thing that the series talks about that I found interesing was in episode 1. It talked about the camera and how developing technology is important and can be very helpful to advancing and connecting society.
A point was made that its important for all to access this developing technology in order for it to serve its purpose of "helping people". 
That stuck out to me because accessability is something that I feel is important to focus on while developing technology and websites. 
Especially with things where it is more successful when more people use/ view it, such as social media, television and even other websites.
