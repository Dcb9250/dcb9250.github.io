<p>how do we remember and commemorate the victims of war?</p>
    <p> it enough to simply list their names in a speech or memorial?</p>
    <p>it is suggested that there is tension between wanting to remember the victims of war and the difficulty of doing so in a way that is meaningful, valuable, and respectful.
    </p>
    <p>Also, many memories come with the heavy emotions that the war had caused, is it better to remember and relive or let those memories fade? </p>
